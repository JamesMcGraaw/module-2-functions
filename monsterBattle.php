Create a "Monster Battle" game.
At this stage, the computer plays the whole game.
No user interaction because we don't know how to do it yet.
Create: A collection of monsters, where each monster has a name and a rating.
E.g. Growler - 8.5, Lucius - 5, etc.
A collection of monster genres, where each genre has a name and a rating.
E.g Vampire - 5, Werewolf - 6, etc.

The battle:
Create a randomised version of the monsters collection.
Combine these monsters with the genres to make a collection that has
elements with a name, a genre and an overall rating.
The overall rating is the total from adding the monster rating and
the genre rating together.
E.g. Growler - Vampire - 13.5, Lucius - Werewolf - 11, etc.
Select two contestants from this new collection.
The contestant with the highest overall score wins.
Equal scores: draw, neither one wins.
Output the result of the battle. E.g. Growler the Vampire beat Lucius the Werewolf.
Use any of the below as additional goals:
